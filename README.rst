pytest.vim
----------
A simple way of running your tests (with py.test) from within VIM.

Talking with Holger Krekel (original author of py.test and vim user) we thought
it would be neat to be able to call it from vim and get some immediate results.

This is especially useful when you are tweaking and do not want to be moving
around between the terminal and your vim session.

Usage
-----

This plugin provides a single command::

    Pytest

It can take a few arguments that are able to be tab-completed. These arguments
are::

    class
    method
    file

As you may expect, those will focus on the tests for the current class, method
or the whole file.

If you are in a class and want to run all the tests for that class, you would
call this plugin like::

    :Pytest class

Whenever a command is triggered a small message displays informing you that
the plugin is running a certain action. In the above call, you would see 
something like this::

    Running tests for class TestMyClass

If you would like to see the complete py.test output you can add a "verbose"
flag to any of the commands for Pytest. For the previous command, it would
look like::

    :Pytest class verbose

This would open a split scratch buffer that you can fully interact with. You
can close this buffer with ':wq' or you can hit 'q' at any moment in that buffer
to close it.

When tests are successful a green bar appears. If you have any number of fails
you get a red bar with a line-by-line list of line numbers and errors.

I strongly encourage a mapping for the above actions. For example, if you
wanted leader mappings you would probably do them like this::

    " Pytest
    nmap <silent><Leader>f <Esc>:Pytest file<CR>
    nmap <silent><Leader>c <Esc>:Pytest class<CR>
    nmap <silent><Leader>m <Esc>:Pytest method<CR>
