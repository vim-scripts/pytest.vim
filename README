A simple way of running your tests (with py.test) from within VIM.

Talking with Holger Krekel (original author of py.test and vim user) we thought
it would be neat to be able to call it from vim and get some immediate results.

This is especially useful when you are tweaking and do not want to be moving
around between the terminal and your vim session.
